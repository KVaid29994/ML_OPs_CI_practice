# ML_OPs_CI_practice
Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) in an MLOps pipeline to automate testing, ensure code quality, and streamline model deployment workflows.


🚀 Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated smoothly into the main branch.
It helps catch bugs early 🐛, maintain code quality ✅, and speed up model delivery 🚚.

🔧 Tools Used:

🐙 Git – Version control for tracking code changes

🔁 GitHub Actions / Jenkins – Automate builds, tests, and integration

🧪 PyTest / UnitTest – For automated testing of ML code

🛡️ Pre-commit Hooks – Linting and formatting checks before pushing code

CI = Code → Test ✅ → Merge 🚀
