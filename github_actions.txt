⚙️ What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool built into GitHub that lets you automate workflows like testing, building, and deploying code every time you push or pull code. 
It uses YAML files stored in .github/workflows/.


✅ Use Cases:
- Run tests on each pull request or push 🔁
- Build and deploy ML models automatically 🤖
- Lint code and check style 🎨 ###In software development, "lint code" or "linting" refers to the process of automatically checking source code for potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues using predefined rules.
- Send alerts or notifications after a job 📢
