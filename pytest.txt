🔍 What is pytest?
pytest is a popular Python testing framework that helps you automate testing of your code.
It checks whether functions return expected results and alerts you if anything breaks.

Think of it like a proof checker for your code—if your logic is wrong or changes unexpectedly, pytest will catch it.

✅ How pytest Works (Step-by-Step):
You write test functions (like test_bmi_calculation) using simple assert statements.

pytest runs these functions and compares actual vs expected results.

If the result matches → ✅ test passes
If not → ❌ test fails and shows why
